# SWIPE' pitch estimator
SWIPE Algorithm implementation in Python
Based on Camacho, Arturo. A sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator for speech and music. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida. 2007.

Implemented in Python by Disha Garg garg.disha8@gmail.com

Pre-requisites:
---------------

Python 3.x


Installation:
-------------

Install all the requirements from 'requirements.txt' file, by running:
	> pip install -r requirements.txt


How to run:
-----------

Run the 'SWIPE.py' python file and it will generate pitches and a pitch contour for you.
An example Audio.wav file has been added to the src directory but you can have the pitch estimation of any audio file. You will just have to provide its full path with name to "WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME" variable in SWIPE.py file.
This will output the pitches and a pitch contour as a .png file.
